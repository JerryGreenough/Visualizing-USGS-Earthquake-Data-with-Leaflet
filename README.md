Visualizing USGS Earthquake Data with Leaflet

The Level 2 option "More Data" has been completed.
This involves using D3 to import JSON strings from 2 different sources:
a) From the USGS to determine all earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 or above that have taken place anywhere in the
world during the past 30 days,
b) From the fraxen/tectonic plates GitHub repo consisting of (lat/long) points representing the world's tectonic plates.

A layer control allows the user to activate labeled earthquake markers and/or tectonic plate boundaries, as well as 
to choose between two world map backgrounds: satellite view or light view.

Temporarily deployed on www.jgxsoft.com/bc17.
